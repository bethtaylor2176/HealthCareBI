# HealthCareBI
This repository has been set up to get my portfolio started. I have lost a significant amount of work that I could have used to showcase my talents and abilities, and I will be working to remediate that going forward.

This project is my first attempt at using Power BI on a home laptop, with several Excel files as my data source. The files were a bit hefty for my computer, so I limited the information to just patients with diabetes or prediabetes.  The anonymized data did not lend itself to many real-world scenarios, so I chose a cohort to display some general demographic information. Given more time and a more robust system with a clear problem to solve, this dashboard could be interesting.

General demographic tab:

Additional information tab: playing around with built-in utilities for analysis and natural-language queries to test out the capabilities.

Seeing Power BI in action has me interested in learning more about it.  I had only been exposed to the tool in demos and am just interacting with it in the wild for the first time.
I look forward to spending more time with the visualizations and formatting in the future.
